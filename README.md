# shadow
determine the direction/length of shadow and display it on a compass depending on the position and time! 
### For the 3d project go to ./sun
- Don't forget to Give the App the location permission
- for better experience Use it from the phone (for using the Gyroscope sensor to Chase your shadow :P )
- it's working at night as well, i was lazy to put a condition to fiz that so ignore this issue please ðŸ™‚

### Todo:
- [x] Get user's position 
- [x] Get sun's Position
- [x] Calculate dirction shadow direction
- [x] Display the shadow in the ui as 2D 
- [x] Change the date with a slider 
- [x] Create a compass using the Gyroscope sensor (works only on phones)
